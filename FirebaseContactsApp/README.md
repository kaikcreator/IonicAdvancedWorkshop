# FirebaseContactsApp

This project is the starting point of the *Ionic Advanced Workshop*

## Installation

If you donâ€™t have ionic installed, please, do it:

```bash
sudo npm install -g ionic
```

Of course, you also need Node and npm. Please, use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install them if needed.


Inside the folder FirebaseContactsApp, there's an Ionic v3.8 skeleton app, built with Ionic CLI.

Install the dependencies

```bash
cd FirebaseContactsApp
npm install
```


Make sure that everything is fine by running the development server

```bash
ionic serve
````

This  must serve the app under http://localhost:8100 with the skeleton content.
