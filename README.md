# IonicAdvancedWorkshop

This project is the starting point of the *Ionic Advanced Workshop*

Download the source code from the repository, at:
https://github.com/kaikcreator/IonicAdvancedWorkshop

This will create a project with 2 folders:
FirebaseContactsApp
FirebaseContactsServer

The folder FirebaseContactsServer contains the cloud functions of the Firebase server that is going to be used in the workshop, but you wonâ€™t be doing anything there.

Open FirebaseContactsApp to start the workshop
